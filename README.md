# How to Stay Private and Anonymous
1. <b>Get a throwaway Virtual Machine</b>: (Or a real machine if you have money)
2. <b>Install linux on the machine</b>: Use Qubes or Tails for most privacy. But that might raise some questions. Especially if you are suddenly going off network, Also Qubes and Tails look quite different from Windows or Mac OS. It might get some eyeballs in a public Place
Install a linux distro that you can easily hide as windows, Kali Linux Undercover mode is one option but it is quite heavy and might cause problems in low hardware, Linux Mint is another option which looks like windows out of the box and is cool on low-end hardware, Dual booting here is easier. Also You can get Parrot OS and install its KDE version and then make it look like Mac OS but that might break the fonts. Easiest way is to install Linux Mint. Make sure to check the "encrypt my home drive" option.
3. <b>Make your Browser Secure</b>: Most linux distro's come preinstalled with firefox. I do not recommend going for any other browser, Especially chromium based ones. Let's go and secure firefox.
First of all Change your default search engine to DuckDuckGo. Then go to Preferences>Privacy and security and then set it to strict. Then install the following extensions:
<ul>
<li>	uBlock Origin</li>
<li>	Privacy Badger</li>
<li>	AdBlocker Plus</li>
<li>	User Agents Switcher</li>
</ul>
Then set your history to delete after you quit firefox<br>
4. <b>Get a VPN</b>: VPN stands for Virtual Private Network. A VPN creates a tunnel between you and the website you are surfing. This tunnel is encrypted and thus your ISP can not see what website are you browsing. To be clear lets see what your ISP can see and what it cant.
<b>https://www.youtube.com</b>/watch?v=QscClVcRTPY
The bold portion is what your ISP can see. So your ISP knows that you are viewing YouTube, but not exactly what you are browsing. But not everytime it's your ISP. Sometimes you may have to work in an environment where your web history is monitored, say for example a working environment in a company or in a university. Also sometimes you need to access some websites that will raise some suspicions like wikileaks. 
So, a VPN will essentially not tell the website address to your ISP and thus you can access some banned content in your country. 
<b> REMEMBER YOU NEED TO ACTUALLY TRUST YOUR VPN PROVIDER TO NOT LEAK YOUR INFORMATION</b>
You should buy a VPN. Some of the best Paid VPNs are:
<ul>
<li>Express VPN</li>
<li>Nord VPN<li>
<li>SurfShark</li>
<li>KeepSolid<li>
<li>IPVanish<li>
<li>CyberGhost</li>
</ul>
If you cant buy a VPN you can still get a free VPN but it wont be just as good
<ul>
<li>ProtonVPN</li>
<li>TunnelBear</li>
<li>Speedify</li>
<li>Hide.me</li>
</ul>
5.<b>Remove All Your Info on your google Account</b>: If you are following till here, you should remove all your info from google. Delete your google account and clean up its data. Delete al of your social media accounts.
6.<b>How to get an online account</b>: Online accounts are needed on the internet but they usually breach your privacy. In this section we will understand how to get an account without breaching your privacy. 

Step 1: Use a fake name

Go to a fake name generator and get a fake name and register your account with the fake name and note it down. Make a complete backstory with fake date of birth, date of place nationality and all. Do not use any of your aliases on the account

Step 2: Use a strong password

Create a unique password for the account. This is neccessary because if someone gets access to one of your accounts, s/he cant get access to your other accounts. Take a best practice advice from me, Make a strong password and then remember a number. put the number after the password and then encrypt it (You need not actually encrypt it, you can just MD5 it). Take an example

I chose a password: #SalluBhairockz

I then choose a number: 144

Then I add the number after the password: #SalluBhairockz144

This password is enough but we need extra security. We will MD5 it.

I went to an MD5 encryptor and then got the following result: b1938c0e1f4dba3afdf8c2cac24fde89

The MD5 version is much better password. Now when you jot down your password, You just have to write #SalluBhairockz; you can remember the number 144 and then MD5 it just before logging in. Do not store your passwords digitally and do not use the save password functionality

Step 3: Use a fake mail

You can just go to 10minutemail.org and then you can get a mail for 10 min and that will be enough for you to create an account and verify it.
