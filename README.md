# How to Stay Private and Anonymous
1. <b>Get a throwaway Virtual Machine</b>: (Or a real machine if you have money)
2. <b>Install linux on the machine</b>: Use Qubes or Tails for most privacy. But that might raise some questions. Especially if you are suddenly going off network, Also Qubes and Tails look quite different from Windows or Mac OS. It might get some eyeballs in a public Place
Install a linux distro that you can easily hide as windows, Kali Linux Undercover mode is one option but it is quite heavy and might cause problems in low hardware, Linux Mint is another option which looks like windows out of the box and is cool on low-end hardware, Dual booting here is easier. Also You can get Parrot OS and install its KDE version and then make it look like Mac OS but that might break the fonts. Easiest way is to install Linux Mint. Make sure to check the "encrypt my home drive" option.
3. <b>Make your Browser Secure</b>: Most linux distro's come preinstalled with firefox. I do not recommend going for any other browser, Especially chromium based ones. Let's go and secure firefox.
First of all Change your default search engine to DuckDuckGo. Then go to Preferences>Privacy and security and then set it to strict. Then install the following extensions:
<ul>
<li>	uBlock Origin</li>
<li>	Privacy Badger</li>
<li>	AdBlocker Plus</li>
<li>	User Agents Switcher</li>
