# How to Stay Private and Anonymous
1. <b>Get a throwaway Virtual Machine</b>: (Or a real machine if you have money)
2. <b>Install linux on the machine</b>: Use Qubes or Tails for most privacy. But that might raise some questions. Especially if you are suddenly going off network, Also Qubes and Tails look quite different from Windows or Mac OS. It might get some eyeballs in a public Place
Install a linux distro that you can easily hide as windows, Kali Linux Undercover mode is one option but it is quite heavy and might cause problems in low hardware, Linux Mint is another option which looks like windows out of the box and is cool on low-end hardware, Dual booting here is easier. Also You can get Parrot OS and install its KDE version and then make it look like Mac OS but that might break the fonts. Easiest way is to install Linux Mint. Make sure to check the "encrypt my home drive" option.
3. <b>Make your Browser Secure</b>: Most linux distro's come preinstalled with firefox. I do not recommend going for any other browser, Especially chromium based ones. Let's go and secure firefox.
First of all Change your default search engine to DuckDuckGo. Then go to Preferences>Privacy and security and then set it to strict. Then install the following extensions:
<ul>
<li>	uBlock Origin</li>
<li>	Privacy Badger</li>
<li>	AdBlocker Plus</li>
<li>	User Agents Switcher</li>
Then set your history to delete after you quit firefox
4. <b>Get a VPN</b>: VPN stands for Virtual Private Network. A VPN creates a tunnel between you and the website you are surfing. This tunnel is encrypted and thus your ISP can not see what website are you browsing. To be clear lets see what your ISP can see and what it cant.
<b>https://www.youtube.com</b>/watch?v=QscClVcRTPY
The bold portion is what your ISP can see. So your ISP knows that you are viewing YouTube, but not exactly what you are browsing. But not everytime it's your ISP. Sometimes you may have to work in an environment where your web history is monitored, say for example a working environment in a company or in a university. Also sometimes you need to access some websites that will raise some suspicions like wikileaks. 
So, a VPN will essentially not tell the website address to your ISP and thus you can access some banned content in your country. 
<b> REMEMBER YOU NEED TO ACTUALLY TRUST YOUR VPN PROVIDER TO NOT LEAK YOUR INFORMATION</b>
You should buy a VPN. Some of the best Paid VPNs are:
<ul>
<li>	Express VPN</li>
<li>	Nord VPN<li>
<li>	SurfShark</li>
<li>	KeepSolid<li>
<li>	IPVanish<li>
<li>	CyberGhost</li>
If you cant buy a VPN you can still get a free VPN but it wont be just as good
<ul>
<li>	ProtonVPN</li>
<li>	TunnelBear</li>
<li>	Speedify</li>
<li>	Hide.me</li>
